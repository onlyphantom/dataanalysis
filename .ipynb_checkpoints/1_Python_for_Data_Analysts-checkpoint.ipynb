    "\n",
    "The coursebook is part of the **Data Analytics Developer Specialization** offered by [Algoritma](https://algorit.ma). It takes a more accessible approach compared to Algoritma's core educational products, by getting participants to overcome the \"how\" barrier first, rather than a detailed breakdown of the \"why\". \n",
    "\n",
    "This translates to an overall easier learning curve, one where the reader is prompted to write short snippets of code in frequent intervals, before being offered an explanation on the underlying theoretical frameworks. Instead of mastering the syntactic design of the Python programming language, then moving into data structures, and then the `pandas` library, and then the mathematical details in an imputation algorithm, and its code implementation; we would do the opposite: Implement the imputation, then a succinct explanation of why it works and applicational considerations (what to look out for, what are assumptions it made, when _not_ to use it etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, experience in Python programming is good to have but not required. Familiarity with data manipulation and data structures in a different programming language a welcome addition but again, not required."

    "We will start off by learning about a powerful Python data analysis library by the name of `pandas`. Its official documentation introduces itself as the \"fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python\", and strive to do so by implementing many of the key data manipulation functionalities in R. This makes `pandas` a core member of many Python-based scientific computing environments.\n",

    "> Python has long been great for data munging and preparation, but less so for data analysis and modeling. pandas helps fill this gap, enabling you to carry out your entire data analysis workflow in Python without having to switch to a more domain specific language like R.\n",
