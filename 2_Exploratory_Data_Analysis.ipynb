    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "## Top-Down Approach \n",
    "\n",
    "The coursebook is part of the **Data Analytics Specialization** offered by [Algoritma](https://algorit.ma). It takes a more accessible approach compared to Algoritma's core educational products, by getting participants to overcome the \"how\" barrier first, rather than a detailed breakdown of the \"why\". \n",
    "\n",
    "This translates to an overall easier learning curve, one where the reader is prompted to write short snippets of code in frequent intervals, before being offered an explanation on the underlying theoretical frameworks. Instead of mastering the syntactic design of the Python programming language, then moving into data structures, and then the `pandas` library, and then the mathematical details in an imputation algorithm, and its code implementation; we would do the opposite: Implement the imputation, then a succinct explanation of why it works and applicational considerations (what to look out for, what are assumptions it made, when _not_ to use it etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This coursebook is intended for participants who have completed the preceding courses offered in the **Data Analytics Developer** Specialization. This is the second course, **Exploratory Data Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The coursebook focuses on:\n",
    "- Date Time objects\n",
    "- Categorical data types\n",
    "- Why and What: Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "- Cross Tabulation and Pivot Table\n",
    "- Treating Duplicates and Missing Values \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this course is a Learn-by-Building section, where you are expected to apply all that you've learned on a new dataset, and attempt the given questions."

    "# Data Preparation and Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "About 60 years ago, John Tukey defined data analysis as the \"procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures ... and all the machinery of mathematical statistics which apply to analyzing dsta\". His championing of EDA encouraged the development of statsitical computing packages, especially S at Bell Labs (which later inspired R).\n",
    "\n",
    "He wrote a book titled _Exploratory Data Analysis_ arguing that too much emphasis in statistics was placed on hypothesis testing (confirmatory data analysis) while not enough was placed on the discovery of the unexpected. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Exploratory data analysis isolates patterns and features of the data and reveals these forcefully to the analyst.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course aims to present a selection of EDA techniques -- some developed by John Tukey himself -- but with a special emphasis on its application to modern business analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous course, we've got our hands on a few common techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.head()` and `.tail()`\n",
    "- `.describe()`\n",
    "- `.shape` and `.size`\n",
    "- `.axes`\n",
    "- `.dtypes`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following chapters, we'll expand our EDA toolset with the following additions:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Tables\n",
    "- Cross-Tables and Aggregates\n",
    "- Using `aggfunc` for aggregate functions\n",
    "- Pivot Tables"

    "## Working with Datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the program's special emphasis on business-driven analytics, one data type of particular interest to us is the `datetime`. In the first part of this coursebook, we've seen an example of `datetime` in the section introducing data types (`employees.joined`).\n",
    "\n",
    "A large portion of data science work performed by business executives involve time series and/or dates (think about the kind of data science work done by computer vision researchers, and compare that to the work done by credit rating analysts or marketing executives and this special relationship between business and datetime data becomes apparent), so adding a level of familiarity with this format will serve you well in the long run. \n",
